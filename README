Fork of deepin-scrot that automatically uploads crops to Dropbox. I made this for myself, so it's not really easy to
use or highly configurable, but feel free to make it reusable.

SYNOPSIS
Deepin Scrot with the ability to save your snapshots directly to Dropbox. It works like this:
  - Take a snapshot the usual way.
  - Select "Save to Dropbox" instead of the old "Save" button.
  - The program saves the snapshot to your public Dropbox folder, generates the public URL for it, puts it into your
  clipboard and plays a sound as feedback.


INSTALLING
Run setup-ubuntu.sh or setup-opensuse.sh with root privileges. Then change the values at the bottom of the
constant.py file to match your Dropbox configuration.


RUNNING
Go to the src folder and run:

python deepinScrot.py

or

./deepinScrot.py

TODO
Change the "Save to Dropbox" icon to show the Dropbox logo instead of a floppy disk.
